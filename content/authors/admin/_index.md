Hi, I'm an electrochemist researching fundamental energy conversion and storage processes in inorganic materials. I'm currently studying interfacial degradation in high energy Li-ion battery cathode materials in the lab of Prof. Bryan D. McCloskey at UC Berkeley. Previously, as a graduate student with Prof. Christopher Chidsey and Prof. Robert Waymouth at Stanford University, I worked on designing molecular electrocatalysts for CO<sub>2</sub> reduction using DFT methods in combination with experimental free energy measurements. 

I enjoy hiking, playing tennis and listening to classical music.
